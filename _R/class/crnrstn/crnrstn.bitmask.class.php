 *   Description :: The CRNRSTN :: Lightsaber RoCEv2 
 *                  SOAP Services Layer, The CLR-SSL 
 *                  is an advanced open source PHP 
 *                  class library that will 
 *                  facilitate and spread (via a 
 *                  SOAP services layer powered by 
 *                  NuSOAP v1.124) the operations of 
 *                  a web application across 
 *                  multiple servers or environments 
 *                  (e.g. localhost, stage, preprod, 
 *                  and n+1 production or a 
 *                  distributed compute of IoT). 
 *
 *                  With this tool, data and 
 *                  functionality possessing 
 *                  characteristics that inherently 
 *                  create distinctions between one 
 *                  environment and another can all 
 *                  be managed through one framework 
 *                  for an entire application. 
 *
 *                  IP address restrictions, error 
 *                  logging profiles, and database 
 *                  authentication credentials are 
 *                  a few areas within an 
 *                  application's architecture that 
 *                  the CLR-SSL has been designed 
 *                  to excel within. 
 *
 *                  Once the CLR-SSL has been 
 *                  configured to support all of a 
 *                  web application's running 
 *                  servers, one can seamlessly RTM 
 *                  the codebase of the web site 
 *                  without having to modify the 
 *                  configuration to account for any 
 *                  unique and environmentally 
 *                  specific parameters. 
 *
 *                  Receive the benefit of a robust 
 *                  and polished framework that will 
 *                  bubble up logs from exception 
 *                  notifications to any output 
 *                  channel (email, hidden HTML 
 *                  comment, native default,...etc.) 
 *                  of one's own choosing. 
 *
 *                  Stand on top of the CLR-SSL in 
 *                  order to, for example, organize 
 *                  and strengthen the 
 *                  communications architecture of 
 *                  any web application. 
 *
 *                  By supporting many-to-one proxy 
 *                  messaging relationships between 
 *                  slaves and a master 
 *                  "communications server", 
 *                  the CLR-SSL is able to 
 *                  streamline and simplify the 
 *                  management of web application 
 *                  communications. 
 *
 *                  One can configure everything 
 *                  from SMTP credentials to the 
 *                  character count for line 
 *                  wrapping in the text versions 
 *                  of multi-part HTML email. 
 *
 *                  The CLR-SSL is the "King's Highway" 
 *                  (Num. 20:17) for communications 
 *                  between the kingdom of our Lord 
 *                  Jesus Christ in heaven, and the 
 *                  people in His earthly kingdom 
 *                  here below. 
 *
 * Numbers 20:17 :: Please let us pass through your 
 *                  land. We will not pass through 
 *                  field or through vineyard, nor 
 *                  will we drink water from any well; 
 *                  we will go along the King’s Highway, 
 *                  not turning aside to the right or 
 *                  to the left, until we pass through 
 *                  your territory.

 * TITLE            :: The Icy Digital ITCC Bitmask
 *                     Integer State (Bit Flip)
 *                     Management Technology
 *                     class object
 * DESCRIPTION      :: Infinite* bits and bit
 *                     handling in general.
 *
 *                     Perceivably, the only
 *                     limit to the bitmask class
 *                     in storing bits would be
 *                     the maximum limit of the
 *                     index number, on 32 bit
 *                     integer systems 2^31 - 1,
 *                     so 2^31 * 31 - 1 = 66571993087
 *                     bits, assuming floats are
 *                     64 bit or something.
 *
 *                     I'm sure that's enough
 *                     enough bits for
 *                     anything...I hope :D.
 *
 *                     *Not infinite, sorry.
 *
 *                     Say... you really want to
 *                     have say... more than
 *                     31 bits available to you in
 *                     your happy bitmask.
 *
 *                     And you don't want to
 *                     use floats.
 *
 *                     So, one solution would to
 *                     have an array of bitmasks,
 *                     that are accessed through
 *                     some kind of interface.
 *
 *                     Here is my solution
 *                     for this:
 *
 *                     A class to store an array of
 *                     integers being the bitmasks.
 *                     It can hold up to 66571993087
 *                     bits, and frees up unused
 *                     bitmasks when there are no
 *                     bits being stored in them.
